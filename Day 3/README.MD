## 🗓️ Day 3 Overview: OOP, Libraries & Mini Projects

**Morning Session – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* Classes and objects
* Attributes, methods, and the `__init__` constructor
* Practice exercises: create `Person` or `Car` class, add methods like `display_info()` and `age()`

**Midday Session – Python Libraries**

* Standard libraries: `random`, `datetime`, `math`
* Optional libraries: `pandas` for data handling, `requests` for web access
* Practice exercises: roll dice, generate random passwords, basic data analysis

**Afternoon Session – Mini Projects**

* **Project 1:** Text-based adventure or quiz game using loops, functions, and optional OOP
* **Project 2:** Small utility programs such as a budget tracker, contact manager, or log analyzer
* **End-of-Day Challenge:** Combine OOP, functions, and libraries into a single project

## 🏁 Exercises in This Folder

1. **OOP Exercises**

   * Create classes with attributes and methods
   * Instantiate objects and call methods
   * Optional challenge: `BankAccount` class with `deposit()` and `withdraw()`

2. **Python Libraries**

   * Use `random`, `datetime`, `math`
   * Optional: `pandas` DataFrame creation and manipulation, `requests` API calls

3. **Mini Projects**

   * Text-based games or quiz apps
   * Utility programs for real-world use
   * Combine OOP, loops, and libraries for a final project

## ✅ Tips for Success

* Test each class or function individually before integrating
* Use meaningful names for classes, variables, and methods
* Keep code modular and organized
* Add optional enhancements like error handling or additional features
