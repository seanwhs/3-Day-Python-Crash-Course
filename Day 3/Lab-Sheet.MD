# Weekend Python Crash Course 🐍  
## Day 3: Lab Sheet – OOP, Libraries & Mini Projects

---

## 🏁 Exercise 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Task 1: Create a `Car` Class
1. Define a `Car` class with attributes: `make`, `model`, `year`.  
2. Add a method `display_info()` that prints all car details.  
3. Create 2 car objects and call `display_info()` for each.

### Task 2: Extend the Class
- Add a method `age()` to calculate car age based on the current year.  
- Test the method with your car objects.

### Task 3: Optional Challenge
- Create a `BankAccount` class with `owner`, `balance` attributes.  
- Add methods: `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`.  
- Test by creating accounts and performing transactions.

## 🔢 Exercise 2: Python Libraries

### Standard Libraries
1. **random**: Write a program to roll two dice and print the sum.  
2. **datetime**: Print the current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format.  
3. **math**: Calculate the square root, power, and factorial of a number.

### Optional Libraries
1. **pandas**: Create a DataFrame with 3 rows: Name, Age, City. Display it.  
2. **requests**: Fetch data from an API (optional) and print the response.

## 🛠 Exercise 3: Mini Projects

### Project 1: Text-Based Adventure / Quiz Game
- Create a game using **functions**, **loops**, and optionally **OOP**.  
- Example:  
  - Present choices to the player.  
  - Track score or progress.  
  - End the game with a summary.

### Project 2: Small Utility Program
- Build a small program, for example:  
  - Budget tracker (add, view, calculate totals)  
  - Contact manager (extend Day 2, add new features)  
  - Log analyzer (read a file and summarize content)

## 💡 Tips
- Test each part (class or function) before integrating into a project.  
- Use meaningful names for classes, variables, and functions.  
- Keep code organized and modular.  
- Encourage adding optional enhancements (extra features, error handling).

---

## ✅ End-of-Day Challenge
- Combine **OOP**, **functions**, and **libraries** in a single project:  
  - Example: A Quiz Game where each **Question** is an object, random questions are selected, and the final score is displayed using `pandas` or printed in a table format.

This **Day 3 Lab Sheet** gives learners:

* Hands-on practice with OOP (classes, methods, objects)
* Library usage exercises (`random`, `datetime`, `math`, optional `pandas`/`requests`)
* Mini-project tasks for real-world application
