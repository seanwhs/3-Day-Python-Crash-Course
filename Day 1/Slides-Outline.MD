## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title:** Weekend Python Crash Course 🐍  
- **Subtitle:** Day 1 – Python Basics & Core Concepts  
- **Instructor Name / Date**  
- Optional: Python logo or fun illustration  

---

## Slide 2: Course Objectives (Day 1)
- Understand what Python is and why it’s popular  
- Install Python and set up an IDE  
- Run Python scripts and use the REPL  
- Learn variables, data types, and basic operators  
- Implement control flow with `if`, `elif`, `else` and loops  

---

## Slide 3: What is Python?
- High-level, interpreted programming language  
- Easy to read and write  
- Used for: web development, data science, automation, games, and more  
- Large supportive community  

---

## Slide 4: Setting Up Python
- Steps to install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- IDE options: VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook  
- Verify installation: `python --version`  
- Screenshot of IDE interface  

---

## Slide 5: Running Your First Script
- Create `hello.py`  
- Code example:
```python
print("Hello, Python!")
````

* Explain REPL vs script execution
* Screenshot of output

---

## Slide 6: Variables

* Definition: store data values
* Examples:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 1.65
```

* Naming rules and conventions

---

## Slide 7: Data Types

| Type  | Example      |
| ----- | ------------ |
| int   | 25           |
| float | 1.65         |
| str   | "Alice"      |
| bool  | True / False |

* Brief explanation of each type

---

## Slide 8: Basic Operators

* Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
* Example code snippet:

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
```

* Quick tip: integer vs float division

---

## Slide 9: Input and Output

* `input()` for user input
* `print()` for output
* Example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

* Tip: converting types (`int()`, `float()`)

---

## Slide 10: Control Flow – If / Else

* Syntax for conditional statements:

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

* Example scenarios

---

## Slide 11: Loops – For

* `for` loop with `range()`

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

* Iterating over lists or strings

---

## Slide 12: Loops – While

* Syntax example:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

* Discuss termination condition and avoiding infinite loops

---

## Slide 13: Mini Exercises

* Print all even numbers 1–20
* Number guessing game instructions
* Encourage pair programming

---

## Slide 14: End-of-Day Challenge

* Create a program that:

  * Asks for name, age, favorite number
  * Prints:

  ```
  Hello <name>! In 5 years, you will be <age+5>. Your favorite number doubled is <favorite_number*2>.
  ```
* Extra: Repeat for 3 users using a loop

---

## Slide 15: Tips & Best Practices

* Save scripts frequently
* Comment your code
* Experiment and debug
* Ask questions and collaborate

---

## Slide 16: Resources

* [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
* [Replit Online IDE](https://replit.com/)
* [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

---

## Slide 17: Thank You / Next Steps
