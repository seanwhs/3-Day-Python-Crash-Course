# Weekend Python Crash Course 🐍  
## Day 1: Lab Sheet – Python Basics & Core Concepts

---

## 🏁 Exercise 1: Hello Python

1. Open your IDE or Python REPL.  
2. Create a new file called `hello.py`.  
3. Write a Python program that:
   - Prints your name.
   - Prints your age.
   - Prints a welcome message.

**Example Output:**
```

Hello, Alice!
You are 25 years old.
Welcome to Python!

```

## 🔢 Exercise 2: Variables and Data Types

1. Create variables for:
   - `your_name` (string)  
   - `your_age` (integer)  
   - `favorite_number` (float)  

2. Print each variable on a new line.

**Bonus:** Print a sentence using all three variables, e.g.,  
```

Alice is 25 years old and her favorite number is 7.5

```

---

## ➕ Exercise 3: Basic Operators

1. Assign values to variables `a = 10` and `b = 3`.  
2. Print the results of:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Modulus
3. Extra challenge: Calculate the area of a rectangle with width = 5 and height = 7.

---

## 🛣️ Exercise 4: Input and Output

1. Ask the user for their **name** using `input()`.  
2. Ask the user for their **age**.  
3. Print a greeting message that includes their name and age.  

**Bonus:** Ask the user for **two numbers** and print their **sum, difference, product, and quotient**.

---

## 🔀 Exercise 5: Control Flow – If/Else

1. Ask the user for a number.  
2. Print whether the number is **positive, negative, or zero**.  

**Bonus:** Ask the user for their age and print:
- “Child” if age < 12  
- “Teen” if 12 <= age < 18  
- “Adult” if age >= 18  

---

## 🔀 Exercise 6: Loops

### Part A – For Loop
1. Print all numbers from 1 to 10.  
2. Print all even numbers from 2 to 20.

### Part B – While Loop
1. Initialize a variable `count = 0`.  
2. Print the value of `count` while `count < 5`, and increment `count` each time.

**Bonus:** Write a number guessing game:
- Program selects a random number between 1–10.  
- User keeps guessing until they find the correct number.  

*Hint: Use `import random` and `random.randint(1,10)`.*

---

## ✅ End-of-Day Mini Project

Create a program that:

1. Asks the user for:
   - Name  
   - Age  
   - Favorite number  
2. Prints:
```

Hello <name>! In 5 years, you will be <age+5>. Your favorite number doubled is <favorite_number*2>.

````
3. Extra challenge: Repeat the program for **3 users** using a loop.

---

## 💡 Tips
- Test each part of your code as you go.  
- Use comments to explain your logic:
```python
# This prints a greeting
print("Hello, world!")
````

* Save your file often.
* Don’t be afraid to make mistakes — debugging helps you learn.
