## 🗓️ Day 2 Overview: Functions, Data Structures & File Handling

**Morning Session – Functions**

* Defining functions with `def`
* Function arguments, return values, and variable scope
* Practice exercises: calculator, dice roll simulation

**Midday Session – Lists, Tuples, Sets & Dictionaries**

* Lists: creation, indexing, and operations
* Tuples: immutability and usage
* Sets: basic operations and uniqueness
* Dictionaries: key-value pairs
* Practice exercises: contact book, shopping list manager

**Afternoon Session – Strings & File Handling**

* String methods, formatting, and f-strings
* Reading and writing files (text and CSV)
* Practical exercise: save and read a mini journal or CSV data

## 🏁 Exercises in This Folder

1. **Functions** – Square numbers, greet users, check even numbers, calculate rectangle area, roll dice
2. **Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries** – Create, modify, and access elements in various data structures
3. **Strings** – Uppercase conversion, vowel replacement, f-string formatting
4. **File Handling** – Read/write text files, create and read CSV files
5. **Mini Projects**:

   * Contact Manager: add, view, search contacts, save to CSV

## ✅ Tips for Success

* Test each function or code snippet before combining into larger programs
* Use comments to explain each part of your code:

```python
# This function calculates the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height
```

* Save all files in a folder named `Day2_Labs`
* Experiment with different data structures to see which fits best
