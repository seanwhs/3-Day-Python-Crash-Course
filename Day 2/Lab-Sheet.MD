# Weekend Python Crash Course 🐍  
## Day 2: Lab Sheet – Functions, Data Structures & File Handling

---

## 🏁 Exercise 1: Functions

1. Write a function `square(number)` that returns the square of a number.  
2. Write a function `greet_user()` that asks for a name and prints `Hello, <name>!`.  
3. Write a function `is_even(number)` that returns `True` if the number is even, otherwise `False`.  
4. Create a function `calculate_area(width, height)` that returns the area of a rectangle.  

**Bonus:** Write a function `roll_dice()` that simulates rolling a six-sided dice and prints the result.

## 🔢 Exercise 2: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

### Lists
1. Create a list `favorite_movies` with 5 movie names.  
2. Add a new movie to the list and print it.  
3. Print the first and last movie in the list.

### Tuples
1. Create a tuple `cities` with 3 cities you want to visit.  
2. Try to modify one of the cities and observe what happens.

### Sets
1. Create a set `numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}`.  
2. Add a new number and print the set.  
3. Remove a number and print the set.

### Dictionaries
1. Create a dictionary `contacts` with 2 entries: name and phone number.  
2. Add a new contact.  
3. Print all contact names.

## 🛠 Exercise 3: Strings

1. Ask the user for their first and last name and print in **uppercase**.  
2. Replace all vowels in a string with `*`.  
3. Format a string using **f-string** to display name, age, and favorite color.

**Example:**  
```

Alice is 25 years old and her favorite color is Blue.

```

## 📄 Exercise 4: File Handling

### Text Files
1. Create a file `quotes.txt` and write 5 lines of your favorite quotes.  
2. Read the file and print each line.  

### CSV Files
1. Create a CSV file `contacts.csv` with columns: Name, Phone, Email.  
2. Add 3 contacts to the CSV.  
3. Read the CSV file and print each contact.

## ✅ Mini Project

**Project 1: Contact Manager**
- Create a program that:
  1. Stores contacts in a dictionary.  
  2. Allows the user to **add**, **view**, and **search** contacts.  
  3. Saves contacts to a CSV file.

**Project 2: Quiz Game**
- Create a list of questions and answers.  
- Ask the user each question in a loop.  
- Track the number of correct answers.  
- Print the final score using an f-string.

## 💡 Tips
- Test each function or snippet separately before combining.  
- Save files in a folder named `Day2_Labs`.  
- Use comments to explain what each part of your code does.  
- Experiment with different data structures to see which fits best.
