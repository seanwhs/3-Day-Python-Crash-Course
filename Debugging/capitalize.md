## Capitalize Method
The code given in the code editor is supposed to print out the capitalized version of "submit". However, there is an issue with the second line which you need to fix.

```
button_label = "submit"
print(button_label.capitalize)

```

## Capitalize All Words
Take a look at the existing code and:

```
sentence = "the sky is blue today."
name = "sarah smith"


```

(1) add a line that capitalizes the first letter of  the string insentence and prints out the result,

(2) add another line that capitalizes both words of the string in name and prints out the result.

The expected output of your code would be:

```
The sky is blue today.

Sarah Smith
```
