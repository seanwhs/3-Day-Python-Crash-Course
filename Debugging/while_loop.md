## Exercise 1
The code below has two bugs. Hunt them down and fix them.

```
while True
print("Hello")
```


## Exercise 2
The programmer here is trying to convert the string "hello" to "HELLO" by using the upper() method:

```
greeting = "hello"
print(upper(greeting))
```
However, the program returns an error. Can you help fix the code, so it prints out HELLO?

## Exercise 3
A programmer wrote the following program:

```
countries = []
 
while True:
    country = input("Enter the country: ")
    countries.append(country)
print(countries)
```

The program doesn't generate an error, but it doesn't produce the expected output. 
Fix the code, so it produces the  expected output.
