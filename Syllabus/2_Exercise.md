# Exercise - Data Types and Variable

1. Declare a variable named **`name`** and assign it a string value representing your name. Then, print the value of the variable to the console.

```
name = "John"
print(name)
```

Output:

```
John
```

1. Declare two variables named **`num1`** and **`num2`** and assign them integer values. Then, use an arithmetic operator to add the two values together and assign the result to a new variable named **`sum`**. Finally, print the value of **`sum`** to the console.

```
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
```

Output:

```
15
```

1. Declare a variable named **`is_raining`** and assign it a boolean value representing whether or not it is currently raining. Then, use an if statement to print the message "Bring an umbrella!" if **`is_raining`** is **`True`**.

```
is_raining = True
if is_raining:
    print("Bring an umbrella!")
```

Output:

```
Bring an umbrella!
```

1. Declare a variable named **`shopping_list`** and assign it a list of strings representing items you need to buy at the grocery store. Then, use list indexing to print the second item on the list to the console.

```
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "bread", "milk"]
print(shopping_list[1])
```

Output:

```
bananas
```

1. Declare a variable named **`my_dict`** and assign it a dictionary with two key-value pairs representing a person's name and age. Then, use dictionary indexing to print the value associated with the "age" key to the console.

```
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(my_dict["age"])
```

Output:

```
30
```

1. Declare a variable named **`my_float`** and assign it a floating-point value. Then, use the **`type()`** function to print the data type of the variable to the console.

```
my_float = 3.14
print(type(my_float))
```

Output:

```
<class 'float'>
```

1. Declare a variable named **`my_list`** and assign it a list of integers. Then, use a **`for`** loop to iterate through the list and print each item to the console.

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5

```

Declare a variable named **`my_string`** and assign it a string value. Then, use string concatenation to create a new string that includes the original string repeated three times. Finally, print the new string to the console.

```
my_string = "Hello"
new_string = my_string * 3
print(new_string)
```

Output:

```
HelloHelloHello
```

1. Declare a variable named **`my_tuple`** and assign it a tuple of strings. Then, use tuple indexing to print the third item on the tuple to the console.

```
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
print(my_tuple[2])
```

Output:

```
orange
```

1. Declare a variable named **`my_dict`** and assign it a dictionary with three key-value pairs representing a person's name, age, and address. Then, use dictionary indexing to print the value associated with the "address" key to the console.

```
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": "123 Main St."}
print(my_dict["address"])
```

Output:

```
123 Main St.
```
