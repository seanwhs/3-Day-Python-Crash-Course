## **Syllabus Description: Python Crash Course **

### **Course Description**

This course provides a structured and hands-on introduction to **Python programming**, designed for beginners with little or no prior coding experience. Learners will develop foundational programming skills by understanding Python syntax, core language constructs, and problem-solving techniques. Through guided lessons, practical exercises, and a capstone project, participants will gain the confidence to write, test, and debug Python programs for real-world use cases.

The course emphasizes **conceptual understanding**, **hands-on practice**, and **good programming habits**, preparing learners for further study in software development, data analysis, automation, or related technical fields.

### **Course Objectives**

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

* Explain how Python programs are structured and executed
* Use variables and built-in data types to store and manipulate data
* Apply operators and control structures to implement program logic
* Write reusable code using functions and modules
* Handle user input, output, and runtime errors effectively
* Understand and apply basic object-oriented programming concepts
* Develop and present a complete Python application as a capstone project

### **Course Structure & Content Overview**

The course is organized into progressive modules that build from fundamentals to practical application:

1. **Introduction to Python**
   Overview of Python, its applications, development environment setup, and basic program execution.

2. **Data Types and Variables**
   Python’s dynamic typing system, built-in data types, variable assignment, mutability, and memory behavior.

3. **Operators**
   Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and membership operators used to construct expressions.

4. **Control Structures**
   Decision-making and repetition using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).

5. **Functions**
   Defining and calling functions, parameters, return values, and code reuse.

6. **Modules**
   Importing and using standard and custom modules to organize and extend programs.

7. **Input and Output**
   Handling user input, formatted output, and basic file input/output operations.

8. **Exception Handling**
   Identifying and managing runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`.

9. **Object-Oriented Programming Basics**
   Introduction to classes, objects, attributes, methods, and basic encapsulation concepts.

10. **Conclusion**
    Review of key concepts and preparation for final assessment and project submission.

### **Learning Activities**

* Guided coding demonstrations
* Hands-on lab exercises and worksheets
* Online practice exercises and code challenges
* Instructor-facilitated discussions and reflections

---

### **Assessment Strategy**

Learner understanding is evaluated through:

* **Code Challenges** – Short programming tasks to reinforce key concepts
* **Online Exercises** – Self-paced practice with immediate feedback
* **Final Assessment** – Evaluation of core Python knowledge and skills
* **Capstone Project: Personal Finance Tracker (Optional)** – A practical application that integrates variables, control structures, functions, modules, and basic object-oriented design

---

### **Capstone Project (Optional) **

Learners will design and implement a **Personal Finance Tracker** using Python. The project requires learners to apply course concepts to build a functional program that manages user input, processes data, and presents meaningful output. This project demonstrates the learner’s ability to translate programming concepts into a real-world solution.
