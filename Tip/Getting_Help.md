## Tip
Often times we used help() and dir() inside an interactive Python shell:
```
>>> dir(str)
```
Please note that if you want to get the output of help and dir from a normal .py file, you have to use a print function, otherwise the .py file will not return any output when executed:
```
print(dir(str))
```
That is because the Python interactive shell uses a print function implicitly, so you don't have to type it in, but this is not the case when the code is inside .py files.
